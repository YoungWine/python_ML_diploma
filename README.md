CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE MODERN READY-TO-EAT FOOD DELIVERY MARKET

There is a pizza delivery company that wants to optimize their marketing campaigns and increase their effectiveness. To build a marketing strategy it is obligatory to understand behaviour of customers. One of the best methods is to do segmentation. I used RFM (recency-frequency-monetary) approach and machine learning algorithm k-means (cluster analysis).

Steps of the work:
1. Downloading the data.
2. Description the data.
3. Preparation the data.
4. Data analysis of the data.
5. Implementation machine learning algorithms.
6. Description of the model's results (description of the segments)

Methods used: RFM segmentation, K-means machine learning method, normalization.
