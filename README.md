CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE MODERN READY-TO-EAT FOOD DELIVERY MARKET


In the last few years, machine learning has become an increasingly relevant technology and is being increasingly introduced into the business environment. It is an algorithm that allows systems to learn and improve without the direct involvement of an IT specialist. Machine learning allows you to extract meaningful information from large arrays of raw data and produce results similar to real indicators. The use of this technology allows you to speed up and automate the process of making business decisions. Machine learning is developing at a high speed and manages new technologies. It can help businesses increase scalability and customize business processes for companies around the world. However, there are few research papers that reveal the practical significance of machine learning in various business areas.

To reveal the practical significance of using machine learning in business, let's look at the ready-to-eat food delivery market using the example of the Dodo Pizza company. In the face of fierce competition, companies are constantly looking for new solutions to retain and attract an audience. The ready-to-eat food delivery market was no exception. In order to maintain competitiveness, it is necessary to respond immediately to changes in the environment, as well as to improve the company's manufacturability through automation and optimization processes. In addition, it is important for a business to understand who its end user is in order to clearly determine its possible market share, build a sales strategy, and also have information about the needs and requests of consumers. To solve these problems, you should contact customer relationship management (CRM). Segmentation, as part of the CRM market, helps to choose suitable communication channels, develop a relevant offer and concentrate resources on marketing campaigns. If a business knows its target audience, then it can win the customer's favor, increase the retention rate, increase loyalty and build long-term and strong relationships. Thus, a strategy within the framework of targeted marketing is important for successful work with clients. However, there is no single strategy that would be suitable for each company. Therefore, each company individually builds its strategy based on the specifics of the market, consumers and the company itself. 

The aim of the work is to segment Dodo Pizza customers based on machine learning to build a CRM strategy for selected groups.
For the successful conduct of the study, the following tasks should be solved ::
1. Conduct a description of the company and industry to identify current problems;
2. Describe the methods that solve the problems of the industry;
3. Describe the tasks that machine learning solves;
4. Conduct an analysis of the company in the field of working with data;
5. Describe the transactional data on which the study will be based;
6. Justify the choice of machine learning application;
7. Justify the choice of machine learning method;
8. Conduct RFM segmentation based on the machine learning method;
9. Interpret the received segments;
10. Develop CRM strategies for the received segments.

The practical significance of the work lies in the fact that it is based on a real company and its transactional data. Thus, the results of this study can be used in practice.

The scientific novelty lies in the fact that there are few examples of using machine learning in the framework of building a CRM strategy and market segmentation. The research done should supplement a number of such works. In addition, there are no universal CRM strategies that would be optimal for any company. Therefore, as part of the work, it is proposed to build a CRM strategy for a certain company.

The object of the study is a chain of pizzerias "Dodo Pizza". Market segments were selected as the subject of the study. The subject area is the ready-to-eat food delivery market.

Methods used: RFM segmentation, K-means machine learning method, normalization, logarithm.
